# SuntimesWidget-nightly

An F-Droid compatible repository containing Suntimes "nightly" builds:
* https://forrestguice.github.io/SuntimesWidget-nightly/fdroid/repo/

Note: The "nightly" builds are not intended for regular use. Use them only to
test or debug specific issues. In particular, these builds are incompatible with
the published addons since they modify applicationId, authorities, and custom 
permissions to allow installation alongside the official release.
